# Writing-Machine
I love DIY projects and this project is my first Arduino project inspired by Tinkernut - https://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Cheap-3D-Printer-From-CD-Rom-Drives/

Most of the parts are the same as shown in Tinkernut instructables. I have used nuts,bolts and small steel angles to make a structure. However, structure wasn't that strong. But, it was enough to make machine work. 

First test video shows that the initial calibration wasn't good enough.
Second test video shows that the size of the writing was too small and hence, less precise.
Third test video shows that the changes I have done to make the size big and final result was good as expected.
